# DITA-OT plugin com.ditalog.kirby.txt

This plugin generates textfiles for Kirby CMS.

This plugin is a slightly adopted version of Jarno ElovirtaÂ´s plugin net.sourceforge.dita-ot.html. It omits completely the navigation templates.

# Under development

The plugin is still under development. Of course you will get txt-files as output. But it is necessary to arrange the dita source files in a certain way. As soon as I have finished I will document it.
