# DITA-OT plugin com.ditalog.kirby.txt

This plugin generates textfiles for Kirby CMS. The DITA-OT plugin only works well if you have placed your DITA source files in a certain way. It is connected with work, but also means a new opportunity to restructure your topics modular.

This plugin is a slightly adopted version of Jarno ElovirtaÂ´s plugin _net.sourceforge.dita-ot.html_. It omits completely the navigation templates.
